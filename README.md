## Description of Testing Strategy
 1. **What kinds of tests did you write? Why?**  
    * First and foremost, I wrote a lot of Unit Tests.  There are many potential failure points throughout this system, and I wanted to be sure that each subsystem (Statement, Expression) was able to handle the errors I would expect from those sections.  This however, was not enough by itself.  Those individual subsystems may be able to handle the errors themselves, but assuring that they would report them properly was a separate issue that I would say falls in the realm of Integration Testing.  
    * I did both manual and automatic Integration Testing for this project.  The manual integration testing was important because I needed to see firsthand that the code was working in unison as I thought it would.  Since, I began the project by creating the REPL mode evaluator and then added the FILE mode evaluator, this was also a prime opportunity to allow my Unit Tests to handle most of the automated process.  By adding a few asserts to my existing unit tests, I could verify that new additions did not cause regression failures throughout the system. By and large the Integration Testing I performed was really just running the older versions of the Unit Tests and Manual Tests, with a few updates for the specific FILE architecture.  
    * Because the REPL mode is fairly UI heavy, I decided that at least some manual tests would be required for that section.  Most of my manual tests are based on the sample output provided by the instructor, but some of them were developed by me to check for more specific edge cases.  I wanted to be sure I covered all my bases in terms of testing this program.  
    *  Because there is a performance requirement as well, I used the VisualVM profiler to evaluate the performance of my program over large files.  It was nearly impossible to look for hotspots in the REPL mode, so creating large files was the best possible alternative to this.
